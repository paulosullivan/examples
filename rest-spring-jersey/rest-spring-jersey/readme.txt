WIP!!!
Project not completed !!!

General
=======
This project will outline how to write a restful service.
It uses the following technologies:

Rest APIs
1) Jersey (backed by Spring)
2) JSON
3) Jackson JSON parser

Misc APIs
1) Servlet API 3.1 (i.e. JEE 7)
2) Spring Framework 4.1.4 (plus Java configuration instead of XML)

Notes
=====
1) There was no jersey-spring4 artifact at the time of writing. However, jersey-spring3 should work with Spring 4.
