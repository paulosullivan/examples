WIP!!!
Project not completed !!!

General
=======
This project will outline how to write a restful service.
It uses the following technologies:

Rest APIs
1) Jersey (backed by Spring MVC)
2) JSON
3) Jackson JSON parser

Misc APIs
1) Project Lombok (not sure if I would use this API again)
2) Version 3.1 of the Servlet specification (i.e. JEE 7)
4) Version 4.1.4 of Spring (plus Java configuration instead of XML)

Notes
=====
1) Project Lombok doesn't support inheritance. It favours composition.
2) There was no jersey-spring4 artifact at the time of writing. However, jersey-spring3 should work with Spring 4.
